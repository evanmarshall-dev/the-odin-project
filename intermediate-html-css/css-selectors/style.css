/* Pseudo-CLASS selectors are prefixed with a single colon and are a different way to target elements that already exist in HTML. Pseudo-ELEMENTS are prefixed with two colons and are used to target elements that don’t normally exist in the markup. If that doesn’t make sense straight away, don’t worry - we’ll explore some examples below. */

/* Pseudo-classes: Pseudo-classes offer us different ways to target elements in our HTML. Some are based on their position or structure within the HTML. Others are based on the state of a particular element, or how the user is currently interacting with it. */

/* :root is a special class that represents the very top level of your document - the one element that has no parents. Generally when working with the web, this is equivalent to the html element, but there are a few subtle differences between :root and html. */

/* :root is generally the place where you will place your ‘global’ CSS rules that you want available everywhere - such as your custom properties and CSS variables, or rules such as box-sizing: border-box;.

:first-child and :last-child will match elements that are the first or last sibling.

Similarly, :empty will match elements that have no children at all, and :only-child will match elements that don’t have any siblings.

For a more dynamic approach we can use :nth-child(n). This is a flexible pseudo-class with a few different uses. */
/*   .myList:nth-child(5) /* Selects the 5th element with class myList */
/*  .myList:nth-child(3n) /* Selects every 3rd element with class myList */
/*  .myList:nth-child(3n + 3) /* Selects every 3rd element with class myList, beginning with the 3rd */
/*  .myList:nth-child(even) /* Selects every even element with class myList */

/* Pseudo-elements: While pseudo-classes give us an alternative way to interact with our HTML elements based on their state or structure, pseudo-elements are more abstract. They allow us to affect parts of our HTML that aren’t elements at all. */

/* ::marker allows you to customize the styling of your <li> elements’ bullets or numbers.
::first-letter and ::first-line allow you to (you guessed it!) give special styling to the first letter or line of some text.
::selection allows you to change the highlighting when a user selects text on the page.
::before and ::after allow us to add extra elements onto the page with CSS, instead of HTML. Using it to decorate text in various ways is one common use case. */
